🍷 Wine Quality Data Analysis — Mini Project
📌 Project Overview
This mini project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) of red wine quality using a real-world dataset. The goal is to identify the factors that influence wine quality and compare top-performing wine samples using visualizations and feature-based filtering.

📁 Dataset
Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository – Wine Quality Dataset

Type: CSV

Samples: 1,599

Features: 11 physicochemical tests + quality rating (score between 0–10)

🔍 Key Objectives
Load and clean the dataset

Remove duplicate entries

Filter wines based on ideal quality ranges

Calculate averages and analyze feature importance

Identify top wine samples based on multiple chemical parameters

Visualize relationships using bar plots and comparison graphs

⚙️ Tools & Libraries Used
Python 🐍

Pandas 📊

NumPy 🔢

Seaborn & Matplotlib 📈

Jupyter Notebook 📒

📈 Key Visualizations
Bar plots comparing top wine samples

Alcohol vs Quality analysis

Feature filtering to narrow down top wines

✅ What I Learned
How to perform real-world data cleaning and filtering

How to apply domain knowledge (wine chemistry) to data

How to create clear and insightful plots

How to tell a story using data

🚀 Future Enhancements
Add correlation matrix to understand feature relationships

Detect outliers using Z-score or IQR

Perform basic clustering of wine types (dry, sweet, etc.)

Extend analysis to white wine dataset
